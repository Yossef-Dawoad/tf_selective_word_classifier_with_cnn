# TensorFlow audio classifier Using CNN Model Architecture

this project is a simple demonstration of the convolution neural network trained to 
classify a 1-second audio segment of audio and output a result of 94% or so 

## How to run the repo
 first of all, you need to install TensorFlow as :
 
 ```Powershell
 pip install tensorflow 
 ```
 
 then run the provided notebook in the directory in the command line:
 
 ```Powershell
 jupyter notebook
 ```
 
 and open `load_train_audio_clf.ipynb` file 
 
 **NOTE**:  as of now the actual preprocessed dataset is in my drive account (size of 600 mb)
 
 if you wish to download here is a link Go to [the Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11lOyNAYxiwLjlaV15utlsx3jrRiah6nW?usp=sharing)
 
 then run each cell to train and evaluate the model accuracy
