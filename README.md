# TensorFlow audio classifier Using CNN Model Architecture

this project is a simple demonstratoin of the convolution neural network trained to 
classify a 1-second audio segment of audio and out put a result of 94% or so 

## How to run the repo
 frist of all you need to install tensorflow as :
 
 ```powershell
 pip install tensorflow 
 ```
 
 then run the provided notebook in the dirctory in commmandline:
 
 ```powershell
 jupyter notebook
 ```
 
 and open `load_train_audio_clf.ipynb` file 
 
 then run each cell to train and evaluate teh model accuracy
